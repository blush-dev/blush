title: "Welcome to Blush"

So, you have installed Blush, a kind-of, sort-of framework for building simple flat-file websites.  I will be honest, you probably should not have done that unless you are OK with fixing things when they go wrong.  And, sometimes, they go very _very_ wrong.

Since you are here, I might as well walk you through a few of the basics.

First, did I already tell you to run for the hills?  _Oh, yeah._  **This is your final warning.**

_You still here?_  OK, let's really get down to business.  You can edit this content here by heading over to your `/user/content/index.md` file.  It is the content of the homepage.  Pretty simple, right?

While we're on the subject of content, it's all pretty structured.  Want a new page at `yoursite.com/about`?  You can just add a `/user/content/about.md` file.  It supports sub-directories too.  So, you can totally do `/user/content/about/index.md` instead.
